**Incentivizing Sustainable Public Transit in India — One Trip at a Time**

---

## 🚀 What is GreenRides Rewards?

**GreenRides Rewards** is a fintech-inspired web application that gamifies the use of public transport in Indian cities.

Users **log their daily trips** (bus/metro), earn **reward points**, track **CO₂ savings**, and **redeem perks** — all through a clean, mobile-friendly dashboard.

Built to **encourage sustainable commuting behavior**, the platform uses tier systems, leaderboards, and a rewards wallet to make eco-friendly transit choices both fun and impactful.

---

## 🌏 Why This Matters

> Despite massive transit infrastructure, India sees **low public transport adoption**, with 71% commuting alone. This leads to:
- 🚗 Excessive congestion
- 🌫️ 90–95% of GHG emissions from non-public transport
- 💸 ₹1.47 lakh crore in economic losses annually

**GreenRides Rewards** offers a positive behavior change model by making **sustainable choices rewarding**.
